Feel free to contribute or adapt the code for your projects. Happy coding! 

CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.



CUSTOMER CHURNPREDICTION

Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-
based service or business. Use historical customer data, including

features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try
algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient
Boosting to predict churn.



SPAM SMS DETECTION

Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages
